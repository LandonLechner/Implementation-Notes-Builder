This is another project I built to improve my coding skills while simultaneously improving a process at my current sales job. Whenever a sales rep would bring on a new client, the sales rep was tasked with creating a lengthy and very specific set of notes for the various teams to reference for that client. The most time consuming part of this process was copying and pasting the pricing (retail and discounted prices) for each and every feature for each and every new client. With the help of this form, I cut a process that often took 15 minutes down to a much more enjoyable experience that often took less than 5 minutes. Although it took much more work and coding, I like the experience of having "pushable" toggle buttons rather than a simple checkbox preceded by a lable. I have created a fake name for the company (same with my Handoff Email Builder project), as well as fake products that replaced the actual ones as to not violate any privacy policies.
